# ZOO800-FinalProject
Final Project for ZOO 800.

This repository contains a brief analysis for field work completed between 2022-2024 looking at the effect of burning on oak savanna field sites across Southern Wisconsin.
My original data has coordinate locations, but I am going to remove it so that it is not publicly on the web... not sure if I should also remove the property names, or randomly reassign them??
